# Find_Inversed_Bases_on_DNA
DNA inversion in modern biology refers to a genetic alteration that occurs within the DNA molecule. It involves the reversal or rearrangement of a DNA segment. DNA is composed of a double helix structure, with genes consisting of nucleotide base pairs along the helix. Inversions typically occur on a single chromosome, where a region of DNA undergoes a reversal, or between two chromosomes, where a segment of DNA switches positions.
